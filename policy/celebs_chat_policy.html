            will continue in full force and effect.</p>
        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms & Conditions are governed by and construed in accordance
            with the internal laws of the State of California without giving

        <h2>12. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to
            these Terms & Conditions or the breach, termination, enforcement,
            interpretation, or validity thereof or the use of the App
            (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled solely by binding
            arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of
            the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The arbitration will
            be conducted in San Francisco, California, USA, by a single
            arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA rules. The
            arbitrator's decision will follow these Terms & Conditions and will
            be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award
            temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief
            providing for specific performance of these Terms & Conditions, but
            only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
            individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the
            arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
            jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party
            will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in
            state or federal court located in San Francisco, California, USA, to
            enforce these Terms & Conditions or prevent an infringement of a
            third party's rights. In the event equitable relief is sought, each
            party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of
            such court.</p>
        <h2>13. Assignment</h2>
        <p>You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any or all of your rights
            or obligations under these Terms & Conditions without our express
            prior written consent. We may assign, transfer, or sublicense any or
            all of our rights or obligations under these Terms & Conditions
            without restriction. These Terms & Conditions are binding upon and
            will inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective
            successors, heirs, executors, administrators, personal
            representatives, and permitted assigns.</p>

            agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the App.</p>
        <h2>15. Waiver</h2>
        <p>No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of
            either party, any right or any power hereunder will operate as a
            waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right
            or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other
            right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between these Terms &
            Conditions and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of
            these Terms & Conditions will govern.</p>
